## Exam Overview
This final exam covers key data science skills, assessing proficiency in data manipulation, analysis, and interpretation using Spreadsheets, SQL, and Python. The exam is divided into three main sections, each focusing on different aspects of data science.

## Sections and Concepts Tested
### Part 1: Spreadsheets (10 Questions, 10 Marks)
Objective: Test the ability to handle data in spreadsheets, perform calculations, and interpret results.

* Files Used: SH_H2O_SAFE.xlsx, SDG_10_7_3.xlsx
* Tools: Google Sheets
* Key Concepts:
  * Data import and organization
  * Formula application and calculations
  * Pivot tables and data visualization
  * Filtering and data cleaning techniques
## Part 2: SQL (20 Questions, 40 Marks)
Objective: Evaluate the ability to query databases, extract insights, and manipulate data using SQL.

* Files Used: TMDB.db, Starter notebook
* Tools: SQLite, Jupyter Notebook
* Key Concepts:
  * Database connections and query execution
  * Data extraction, aggregation, and filtering
  * Joins, subqueries, and nested queries
  * Data transformation using SQL functions
## Part 3: Python (15 Questions, 25 Marks)
Objective: Test Python skills for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization using the Pandas library.

* Files Used: football_players.csv
* Tools: Python (Pandas library), Jupyter Notebook
* Key Concepts:
  * Data loading and preprocessing
  * Data cleaning and handling missing values
  * Statistical analysis and data visualization
  * Performance optimization using Pandas
## Datasets Used
* `SH_H2O_SAFE.xlsx`: Data on safe water access.
* `SDG_10_7_3.xlsx`: Data related to Sustainable Development Goals.
* `TMDB.db`: A database containing movie-related data for SQL queries.
* `football_players.csv`: A dataset with football player statistics for Python analysis.
## Solution Approach
### Handling Spreadsheet Data
* Imported data into Google Sheets for analysis.
* Utilized advanced formulas and functions for calculations.
* Created pivot tables and charts to visualize trends.
## SQL Queries and Data Extraction
* Connected to TMDB.db using SQLite in a Jupyter Notebook.
* Used complex SQL queries to extract insights, including joins and subqueries.
* Analyzed data patterns and presented results clearly.
## Python Analysis with Pandas
* Loaded and cleaned data using Pandas.
* Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends.
* Created visualizations to represent findings effectively.
## Results and Success Rate
With a meticulous approach and thorough understanding of data handling techniques, I achieved a success rate of 99% across all sections of the exam.

## Learning Outcomes
* Mastery of data analysis using Spreadsheets, SQL, and Python.
* Developed skills in data extraction, cleaning, and visualization.
* Enhanced ability to interpret data-driven insights for decision-making.
